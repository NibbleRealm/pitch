Quickly and accurately determine the pitch and volume of a sound sample.

This crate uses a [Bitstream Autocorrelation Function (BCF)] invented by Joel de
Guzman to determine the pitch of the sound sample.

## Features

 - Determine pitch of an audio wave using Bitstream Autocorrelation (BCF)

## Roadmap to 1.0 (Future Features)

 - Try using BACF, the updated version of BCF, which uses peaks rather than
zero-crossings.  Evaluate Speed vs accuracy benifits / downfalls.  Method
differences described [here].

### Supported Platforms

Pitch targets all platforms that can run Rust, and contains no platform-specific
code.

## MSRV

The current MSRV is Rust 1.85.

Any future MSRV updates will follow the [Ardaku MSRV guidelines].
